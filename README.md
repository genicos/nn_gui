# Neurula, a website for graphically designing neural networks

A drag-n-drop based GUI for designing neural networks.

The blocks represent the layers of the network, or operations on tensors.

Once the network is designed you can download auto-generated code that implements that network in pytorch or tensorflow.

# Code we wrote
The code we wrote can be found in front/src/
as well as 
front/build/tf_code_generator.py
front/build/pytorch_code_generator
front/build/index.html

the rest is auto generated by svelte

# Index.html
The webpage can be found in front/build/index.html

# Hosted website
can be found at https://neurula.onrender.com/

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
----------------------------------------
This directory always refers to the directory this README is contained in (the root directory of the repository)
These steps work in an unix or mac enviroment

# Initial set up
    In this directory:

    If you're not on a Mac: Install npm 
    $ sudo apt install npm

        if some fail to install, do
        $ sudo apt-get update
        then run again
    

    Install requirements
    $ pip install fastapi
    $ pip install uvicorn

    Now to set up svelte

    enter front/
    $ cd front/

    Install requirements
    $ npm install

    Build svelte app
    $ npm run build


# To run on local host
    In this directory:
    $ uvicorn api:app --reload

    Once you're done
    Ctrl-C to kill process

# To see a change youve made
    
    Rebuild svelte app
    $ cd front
    $ npm run build

    You may have to clear your browser cache
        For chrome
            click three dots on right
