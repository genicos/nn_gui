The following are tests done manually to test the full website stack for
creating tensorflow neural networks


LAYERS AND ACTIVATIONS:
    These tests ensure that all layers and activation functions can be created
    The following networks were created with the website, and then
    compiled and trained on MNIST data

    All of the following used the 'Adam' optimizer, 
    and the 'Categorical Cross Entropy' loss function
