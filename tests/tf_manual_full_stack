The following are tests done manually to test the full website stack for
creating tensorflow neural networks


LAYERS AND ACTIVATIONS:
    These tests ensure that all layers and activation functions can be created
    The following networks were created with the website, and then
    compiled and trained on MNIST data

    All of the following used the 'Adam' optimizer, 
    and the 'Categorical Cross Entropy' loss function

    Networks:
        Dense

        Dense, Softmax

        Dense, Identity

        Dense, ReLU

        Dense, PReLU

        Dense, Softplus

        Dense, Swish

        Dense, Sigmoid

        Dense, Softsign

        Dense, Tanh

        Conv2d, GlobalAvgPool

        Conv2d, Max pool, Dense

        Conv2d, Avg pool, Dense

        ZeroPadding, Conv2d, Dense
